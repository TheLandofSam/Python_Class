# would be nice to add: 
# more loot items
# useable potions
# ability to use the loot that is collected to augment health or strength or give a defense bonus
# ability to drop items
# max carry weight
# special narrative for doom
# need to re-write and add taunts for the Brownies, but I would like to add a random annoyance handicap to the hero for the taunts
